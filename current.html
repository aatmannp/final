                <h1 style="color: darkred; line-height: 50px;">How to act against inflation </h1>
                In a comically audacious move, the government has unveiled its latest strategy to combat inflation: the "Just Pretend It's Not Happening" initiative. Economists and citizens alike are scratching their heads as officials encourage a collective denial of rising prices. The groundbreaking plan includes distributing blindfolds labeled "Inflation Blockers" to the public and hosting nationwide events where participants practice turning a blind eye to soaring costs. Critics argue that this approach might be more suited to a sitcom than economic policy, expressing concerns about the impact on purchasing power. Meanwhile, citizens navigate the absurdity, wondering if pretending is the new solution to real-world problems. So basically, just forget about it.

               In a groundbreaking revelation that challenges centuries-old scientific consensus, a group of rogue scientists has purportedly confirmed that the Earth is indeed flat, casting doubt on established principles of physics. Citing unconventional experiments and selectively interpreted data, these self-proclaimed experts boldly declare that gravity is an elaborate hoax perpetrated by mainstream science. They argue that the perceived force of gravity is merely an optical illusion, asserting that if the Earth were truly round, people on the opposite sides would experience insurmountable discomfort. Seemingly dismissing centuries of empirical evidence, these renegade scientists claim that the curvature of the Earth is an optical trick, and that the flatness of the horizon is proof of our planet's pancake-like existence. While their theories lack support from the wider scientific community, their controversial claims have found a niche following, sparking debates and raising questions among those who are inclined to question established knowledge.
